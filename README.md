# Web Development Project 4 - DexDive

Submitted by: **Xavier Gonzalez**

This web app: **Expands upon my flashcard project by including all 1025 current pokemon with some fun data related to each**

Time spent: **20** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed: 

- [x] **Application features a button that creates a new API fetch request on click and displays at least three attributes and an image obtained from the returned JSON data**
  - The type of attribute displayed for each image should be consistent across API calls (i.e. if you are using a cat API, and display the color, breed, and age in response to an initial API call, subsequent button clicks should also result in the color, breed, and age being displayed)
- [x] **Only one item/data from API call response is viewable at a time and at least one image is displayed per API call**
  - A single result of an API call is displayed at a time 
  - Displayed attributes should match the displayed image (i.e., if showing a picture of a Siamese cat and the attribute breed, the displayed breed should be 'Siamese' not 'Ragdoll' or another breed that doesn't match)
  - There is at least one image per API call
- [x] **API call response results should appear random to the user**
  - Clicking on the API call button should generate a seemingly random new result each time
  - Note: Repeat results are permitted but the API used should have a reasonably large amount of data and repeats should not be frequent
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban **list**
  - At least one attribute for each API result should be clickable
  - Clicking on a clickable attribute not on the ban list, should imnmediately add it to the ban list 
  - Clicking on an attribute in the ban list should immediately remove it from the ban list 
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**
  - Clicking on the API call button should not result in any image/attributes with attribute values in the ban list being displayed (ex. Using a cat API, if the ban list includes the value 'Siberian' for the breed attribute, clicking on the Discover button should never result in a Siberian cat being displayed)
  - Note: More attribute values on the ban list may result in a higher frequency of repeat results
  -  [x] _To ensure an accurate grade, your recording **must** show that when clicked, an attribute in the ban list is immediately removed from the list of banned attributes_


The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes are clickable and can be added to the ban list
- [x] Users can see a stored history of their previously displayed  results from this session
  - A dedicated section of the application displays all the previous images/attributes seen before
  - Each time the API call button is clicked, the history updates with the newest API result

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] Two types of "bans" with the normal attribute one and whole display element type
